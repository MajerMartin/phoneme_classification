# Thesis - Phoneme Classification

Phoneme classification using multiple methods:
* Feed-forward neural network + Viterbi decoding
* Recurrent neural network (LSTM/GRU) + Viterbi decoding
* Seq2Seq recurrent neural network

Tested on log filterbank energies and MFCC both with and without delta/delta-delta coefficients.
